# DailyDashboard
This is a python program I wrote to simplify one aspect of my morning. 
Each morning, two of the main things I do are check the weather and decide what to wear. 
Taking some inspiration from the story of Mark Zuckerberg wearing similar clothes each day to remove the hassle of choosing an outfit,
I decided to write a program that would email me all of the relevent weather information for the day, as well as a clothing reccomendation based upon the 
weather forecast. On my machine, the program is scheduled to run once every morning.
